# Demo 1: PSyclone transformations from the command line
# ======================================================
#
# Here we demonstrate how to run PSyclone in code transformation mode from the
# command line. Despite being in 'transformation mode', we won't actually apply
# any code transformations in this demo. We'll simply read some Fortran source
# code and then write it out to a different file.
#
# .. warning::
#    The first, important thing to note is that these demos are not intended to
#    be run directly.
#
# Instead of running the demos as Python scripts, they should be passed as
# transformation scripts for the ``psyclone`` command. This command will only
# install PSyclone be available if you have activated the virtual environment
# you used to (and PSyACC).
#
# The recommended command for this demo is as follows.
#
# .. literalinclude:: 01_psyclone.sh
#    :language: bash
#    :lines: 8-
#
# There is a lot to unpack here! Let's work through the arguments one by one.
#
# API
# ---
#
# PSyclone requires an API to be chosen, i.e., the argument following ``-api``.
# Since PSyACC is designed to use the NEMO API, we should always choose this.
#
# Source code
# -----------
#
# Perhaps the most important argument is the source code to be transformed (the
# last argument). We provide a subdirectory of Fortran source to be used for
# this purpose. In this demo, we parse the ``empty.F90`` file, which contains a
# 'Hello, World!' Fortran program:
#
# .. literalinclude:: fortran/empty.F90
#    :language: fortran
#    :lines: 6-
#
# Transformation script
# ---------------------
#
# The ``--script`` option is used to provide a transformation script to
# PSyclone. In this case, we pass this file. Given that almost all of it is
# comprised of comments, the only Python syntax that will be picked up is the
# following. ::


def trans(psy):
    print("Hello, PSyACC World!")
    return psy


# The transformation function *must* have the name ``trans``, *must* have a
# single argument (the :py:class:`psyclone.psyGen.PSy` instance), and *must*
# return the same :py:class:`psyclone.psyGen.PSy` instance, usually modified in
# some way. In this demo, we don't actually make any modifications and instead
# just say hello to the user.
#
# Output file
# -----------
#
# Finally, we need to tell PSyclone where to write the transformed code to. If
# this argument is dropped then the transformed code will be printed to screen.
# We pass the location ``outputs/01_psyclone-empty.F90`` as a combination of
# the names of the source file and transformation script. The ``output``
# subdirectory should have been created when you installed PSyACC.
#
# Inspecting the output file, it should look something like.
#
# .. literalinclude:: outputs/01_psyclone-empty.F90
#    :language: fortran
#
# It doesn't take a Fortran expert to realise that running the two versions of
# the Fortran code will give the same result. However, the files themselves are
# slightly different, even though the transformation function that we used was
# trivial. The reason for this is that PSyclone always reformats code according
# to its in-built preferences. In particular, it will use lower case (for the
# most part) and will put a single blank line at the start and end of any
# program.
#
# In the `next demo <02_kernels.py.html>`__, we'll develop a more interesting
# transformation script, which uses PSyACC to apply an OpenACC ``kernels``
# directive to a simple loop.
#
# This demo can also be viewed as a `Python script <02_psyclone.py>`__.
